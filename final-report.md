# Final Report â€“ Core Program Brazil 2025

## Introduction

The Core Program Brazil 2025 marked the beginning of a long-term effort to establish a strong foundation for Programmable Cryptography in Brazil. The program was organized jointly by [ERC55](https://erc55.xyz/) and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/), with the mission of empowering advanced learners and practitioners to become multipliers of knowledge, creating the first generation of mentors, educators, and workshop leaders in the country.

This inaugural edition prioritized participants with senior profiles, capable of absorbing advanced content and transmitting it further to the local and global community. The results of this pilot initiative demonstrate that Brazil is ready to position itself as a relevant actor in the global cryptography ecosystem.

## Participants and Selection Process

The program received **51 applications**. After the first evaluation, **24 candidates** advanced to the final stage. Following joint deliberation between ERC55 and the Ethereum Foundation, **19 participants** were selected.

The evaluation criteria included:
- Self-learning skills and teamwork  
- Programming skills and depth  
- Cryptography maturity  
- Motivation and practical application  
- Time commitment  
- General fit and attitude  
- Open-source mindset  
- Interest in Programmable Cryptography  
- Deliveries and checks (in-person and in English)  

These criteria ensured that selected participants not only possessed technical knowledge but also the right mindset to contribute to open collaboration and community growth.

## Mentorship

The program had the support of **five mentors**, who contributed by sharing their knowledge and providing occasional guidance to participants throughout the program.

## Academic and Technical Content

The curriculum was intentionally **non-linear**, reflecting the exploratory nature of Programmable Cryptography. The sessions combined lectures, workshops, and hands-on projects, covering the following topics:

- Kick-off call with Jaf (Ethereum Foundation, ZKET)  
- New cryptographic constructions: ZKP, FHE, MPC  
- Introduction to Circom  
- Neutrosophic Cryptography  
- VerITAS  
- Intro to Noir    
- Baby steps in FHE  
- Mathematics underlying DFT variants  
- FFT, AIR, and FRI lectures  
- PLONK lecture  
- FHE Workshop with Fhenix  
- Introduction to ZkTLS  
- ZK use-cases presentations  
- Semaphore  
- Final project presentations  
- Frontier technologies  

This non-linear approach allowed participants to explore diverse areas while maintaining focus on foundational and frontier knowledge.

## Communication and Outreach

The program was promoted across multiple channels to ensure broad and diverse participation:

- Universities and academic partners  
- Social networks (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)  
- WhatsApp and Telegram groups  
- Local and regional press  
- Collaborations with other communities  

All program videos were recorded and published on the **ERC55 YouTube channel**, ensuring open access for future learners and contributors.

## Venue and Logistics

The initial plan was to host the program within universities to foster direct ties with academia and reduce costs. However, after evaluating structural requirements and accessibility, the decision was made to rent a coworking space. This ensured reliable infrastructure, central location, and professional facilities suitable for advanced technical sessions.

## Budget

The program operated under a **total budget of 4,000 USD**, distributed as follows:

| Category          | Amount (USD) |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Venue             | 1,962.47     |
| Lunch & Snacks    | 1,521.32     |
| Scholarships      | 500.00       |
| Other expenses    | 20.00        |
| **Total**         | **4,003.79** |

The careful financial planning ensured participants had a comfortable environment, and access to food and snacks during the days.

## Outcomes and Impact

The Core Program Brazil 2025 successfully:

- Built the **first local network of advanced Programmable Cryptography practitioners**.  
- Prepared participants to **lead workshops, deliver courses, and mentor future cohorts**.  
- Expanded the **educational infrastructure** in Brazil by creating accessible video resources and project examples.  
- Strengthened the **collaboration between ERC55, Ethereum Foundation, and local communities**.  

This first edition has established a replicable framework that can be scaled within Brazil and exported to other regions in Latin America.

## Conclusion

The Core Program Brazil 2025 represents a milestone for the growth of Programmable Cryptography in Brazil. By focusing on senior participants, combining diverse topics, and fostering collaboration, it has laid the foundation for a sustainable ecosystem. The program not only trained individuals but also built capacity for community-led education and mentorship in the years to come.

This achievement was made possible by the joint efforts of ERC55, the Ethereum Foundation, the mentors, and all the participants who dedicated themselves to advancing knowledge and practice in this frontier field.
