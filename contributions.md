### RISC Zero REVM Integration

**Contributors:**

- Antonio Viggiano - [@aviggiano](https://github.com/aviggiano)

**Project Description:**
This project demonstrates the integration between RISC Zero zkVM and the revm Ethereum Virtual Machine library, enabling zero-knowledge proof generation for EVM bytecode execution. The implementation showcases how to execute smart contracts privately while maintaining verifiable correctness through zkSNARKs, opening possibilities for private smart contract execution, EVM-compatible rollups, cross-chain verification, and auditing tools.

The main objective of this proof-of-concept is to showcase how a Zero-Knowledge Bug Bounty Program (ZKBBP) can be built. In such a system, a whitehat proves knowledge of a private bytes input $I$ that, when sent to a public function $F$ on public bytecode $B$, produces a public $true$ output. The proof reveals only commitments (hashes of code and calldata), ensuring the exploit input remains secret until disclosure is negotiated. Verifiers (on-chain or off-chain) can check the ZK receipt and be assured the claim is valid without ever learning the exploit itself. 

This minimal implementation provides the scaffold for building more advanced ZKBBPs where: Arbitrary EVM bytecode can be executed under proof, vulnerability classes can be modeled as verifiable predicates, and payout mechanisms can be automated on-chain once proofs are verified.

**Technical Stack:**

- Rust
- RISC Zero zkVM
- revm (Rust EVM implementation)
- Ethereum Virtual Machine
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs)

**Project Goals:**

- Demonstrate seamless integration between RISC Zero and revm
- Enable private smart contract execution with proof generation
- Provide foundation for EVM-compatible zero-knowledge applications
- Showcase cross-chain verification capabilities
- Create auditing tools for contract behavior verification

### ZK Air Drop

**Contributors:**

- Arthur F. Abeilice - [@afa7789](https://github.com/afa7789)

**Project Description:**
ZK Air Drop enables any eligible user to privately claim tokens from an airdrop using zero-knowledge proofs and Merkle trees. The user‚Äôs wallet address is included in the Merkle tree, and a ZK proof is generated off-chain to prove eligibility without revealing the full list or identity. The proof can be used to claim tokens from any wallet, anywhere, ensuring privacy and flexibility for claimants.

**Technical Stack:**

- Solidity
- Circom
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Ethers.js
- Foundry
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16) snarkjs

**Project Goals:**

- Allow private, universal token claims for airdrops
- Enable proof generation for any wallet address in the Merkle tree
- Prevent double-claims and Sybil attacks with ZK verification
- Provide a simple web interface for proof generation and claiming

### Farewell

**Contributors:**

- Pedro G. M. R. Alves - [@pdroalves](https://www.iampedro.com)

**Project Description:**
Farewell is a proof-of-concept dApp that allows people to leave posthumous encrypted messages for their loved ones. Using blockchain smart contracts combined with [fhEVM](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm), the system securely stores secret shares of keys and encrypted payloads. A ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù mechanism ensures that messages are only released after a period of user inactivity, making Farewell a cryptographic time capsule designed to endure for decades.

**Technical Stack:**

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- fhEVM
- React (frontend)

**Project Goals:**

- Provide a reliable and private mechanism for leaving encrypted messages that will only be released after death or prolonged inactivity.
- Leverage blockchain persistence and cryptography to ensure fairness, security, and decentralization.
- Explore integration of FHE and ZK proofs (e.g., ZKMail) for privacy-preserving proofs of delivery.

### Circom circuit verification with Clean

**Contributors:**

- Christiano Braga - [@christianobraga](https://github.com/ChristianoBraga)
- Semar Augusto Martins - [@semaraugusto](https://github.com/semaraugusto)

**Project Description:**

ZK circuit verification is a major task in software engineering for ZK protocols. Given a verification framework, one needs to:
1. specify the circuit in the framework specification language;
2. state the pre and post-conditions of the circuit (as in [Hoare Logic](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/tony-hoare/logic.html));
3. prove the circuit's soundness and completeness using the verification framework. Quoting [https://blog.zksecurity.xyz/posts/clean/](https://blog.zksecurity.xyz/posts/clean/):
- Soundness: if the prover can exhibit any witness that satisfies the constraints and lookup relations defined by the circuit, then some specification property holds over that witness. Proving this property ensures that the circuit is not underconstrained.
- Completeness: for every possible input, an honest prover can always exhibit a witness that satisfies the constraints and lookup relations defined by the circuit. Proving this property ensures that the circuit is not overconstrained.

We took a deep dive in Lean 4 and Clean in the 2nd. half of the program and interacted with Clean's team to understand their approach. These interactions lead to jointly concluding the specification and proof (of soundness and completeness) of Circomlib's [`Num2Bits`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/clean/blob/62eb4edde2855c0403df9ad7e8d0c0a391958103/Clean/Circomlib/Bitify.lean#L135). Our team alone [proved](https://github.com/ChristianoBraga/clean/blob/ff2f656a325c974dfcf3ec9df4795584db85a36f/Clean/Circomlib/Comparators.lean#L46) the soundness and completeness of Circom's circuit [`IsZero`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/clean/blob/62eb4edde2855c0403df9ad7e8d0c0a391958103/Clean/Circomlib/Comparators.lean#L14). This lead to [PR 265](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/clean/pull/265) at Clean's github.

**Technical Stack:**

- [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/)
- [Clean](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/clean/) 

**Project Goals:**

1. Prove Circom circuits sound and complete.
2. Learn about theorem proving with Clean.
